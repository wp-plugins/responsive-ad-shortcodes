Advanced Wordpress plugin to insert Google Adsense / DoubleClick to your posts, pages and sidebar.

== Description ==

<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/responsive-ad-shortcodes/" target="_blank">Responsive Ad Shortcodes</a> is a WordPress plugin that was built to scratch an itch. For some time, we've been trying to get AdSense and DoubleClick to play nice with responsive websites. Not easy, as the responsive ad offerings from Google fall very short and offer little control. This plugin aims to address this, allowing users to control ad display on 3 types of screen (small, medium & large). And blend ads from AdSense and DoubleClick into single units.

Because of the focus on control and flexibility this plugin uses VERY verbose shortcodes. It is not designed for newbies. If you want a simple AdSdene short code manage, take a look at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-plugin-for-simple-google-adsense-insertion/" target="_blank">WP Simple AdSense Insertion</a>.

3. Go to Settings and configure the options eg. Copy and paste the Google Adsense code that you want to use.
